Since this development activity should not disturb the normal project work, the only possibility is use after office hours and weekens. The following are the possibilities
  * Team members have to commit for at least a month commitment to this project
  * The work should happen during weekends and after office hours
  * Daily Stand-up may be not feasible, so two times a week can be followed
  * There needs to be a Friday evening stand up to gear up for the weekend.
